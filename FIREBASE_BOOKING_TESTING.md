# Firebase Booking System - Testing Guide

## üîç Issues Found & Fixed

### **Problem with Your 8:00 AM + 2 Hours Booking:**

**What was happening before:**
1. The booking system was still using `SecureBookingStorage` (localStorage) instead of Firebase
2. Duration logic was flawed - booking 8:00 AM for 2 hours only blocked 8:00 AM, not 8:30, 9:00, 9:30
3. No real-time sync between different devices/browsers

**What's been fixed:**
1. ‚úÖ **Switched to Firebase**: BookingSystem now uses `FirebaseBookingService`
2. ‚úÖ **Fixed Duration Logic**: 2-hour booking now blocks all required time slots
3. ‚úÖ **Real-time Sync**: Changes appear instantly on all devices
4. ‚úÖ **Conflict Prevention**: Can't book overlapping time slots
5. ‚úÖ **Better UI**: Shows which slots belong to which booking session

## üìä How Firebase Database Should Look Now

When you book **8:00 AM for 2 hours**, Firebase should contain:

```json
{
  "rooms": {
    "1": { "name": "Salle 1", "capacity": 15 },
    "2": { "name": "Salle 2", "capacity": 9 },
    "3": { "name": "Salle 3", "capacity": 9 }
  },
  "bookings": {
    "-randomFirebaseId": {
      "id": "-randomFirebaseId",
      "roomId": "1",
      "day": "Lundi",
      "timeSlot": "08:00",
      "teacherName": "Your Name",
      "subject": "Your Subject",
      "studentCount": 5,
      "duration": 2,
      "contactInfo": "Your Contact",
      "bookingDate": "2025-09-09T12:00:00.000Z",
      "createdBy": "Your Name"
    }
  },
  "timeSlots": ["08:00", "08:30", "09:00", "09:30", "10:00", ...],
  "weekDays": ["Lundi", "Mardi", "Mercredi", "Jeudi", "Vendredi", "Samedi"],
  "lastUpdated": "2025-09-09T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## üéØ Time Slot Logic Now Working

**When you book 8:00 AM for 2 hours:**
- **Blocks**: 8:00, 8:30, 9:00, 9:30 (4 slots = 2 hours)
- **Shows in UI**: All 4 slots appear as "R√©serv√©" (red)
- **Tooltip Info**: Shows which slot is the start of the session vs. continuation
- **Cancel Button**: Only appears on the starting time slot (8:00)

## üß™ How to Test

### 1. **Check Firebase Console**
1. Go to your Firebase Console ‚Üí Database
2. Look for the structure above
3. Verify your booking appears with correct duration

### 2. **Test Duration Blocking**
1. Book 8:00 AM for 2 hours
2. Try to book 8:30 AM - should be blocked (red)
3. Try to book 9:00 AM - should be blocked (red)  
4. Try to book 10:00 AM - should work (green)

### 3. **Test Real-Time Sync**
1. Open `/booking` in two different browser tabs
2. Create booking in tab 1
3. Should appear instantly in tab 2

### 4. **Test Conflict Prevention**
1. Book 8:00 AM for 2 hours
2. Try to book 9:00 AM for 1 hour
3. Should show conflict error message

### 5. **Test Cross-Device Sync**
1. Book from your computer
2. Check on your phone at same `/booking` URL
3. Should see the same booking

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Firebase not available" Error
**Cause**: Firebase config not set up
**Fix**: 
1. Check `.env` file has correct Firebase config
2. Verify Firebase project exists and database is enabled
3. Check browser console for specific errors

### Bookings Not Syncing
**Cause**: Firebase rules or network issues
**Fix**:
1. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Rules
2. Ensure rules allow read/write
3. Check internet connection

### Time Slots Not Blocking Correctly  
**Cause**: Duration calculation error
**Fix**: 
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `getAffectedTimeSlots` function is working
3. Test with different durations (0.5h, 1h, 2h, 3h)

## üìã Expected Behavior Summary

‚úÖ **Book 8:00 AM + 2h** ‚Üí Blocks 8:00, 8:30, 9:00, 9:30
‚úÖ **Real-time sync** ‚Üí Changes appear on all devices instantly  
‚úÖ **Conflict prevention** ‚Üí Can't double-book overlapping times
‚úÖ **Smart UI** ‚Üí Shows session start vs. continuation slots
‚úÖ **Firebase storage** ‚Üí Data persists across sessions
‚úÖ **Multi-teacher support** ‚Üí Multiple teachers can use simultaneously

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Complete Firebase Setup**: Follow `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` if not done
2. **Test All Scenarios**: Try different rooms, days, durations
3. **Add Teachers**: Have multiple people test from different devices
4. **Production Deploy**: Deploy with Firebase config to production

Your Firebase booking system is now ready for multi-teacher, multi-device usage! üöÄ
