Can we use Brevo API to subscribe users  in mour mailing lists from our website?

Yes, you can use Brevo's API to subscribe users to your mailing lists directly from your website. Here's how you can do it:

Obtain Brevo API Key: First, you need your Brevo API v3 key to authenticate your requests. You can generate this key from the Brevo dashboard under the API & SMTP settings.

Create a Subscription Form: You can create a sign-up form on your website that captures user information and sends it to Brevo. This form can be customized to match your website's design and branding.

Use the API to Add Contacts: With the API, you can add the collected contact information directly to your Brevo lists. Make sure to handle consent appropriately to comply with GDPR regulations.

For more detailed information, refer to Brevo's API documentation and consider integrating using plugins or tools like Zapier for easier setup.
